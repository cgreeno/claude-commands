Review the project context to pick up where we left off:

1. Read all CLAUDE.md files in this project
2. If a .claude directory exists in this project, read everything inside it
3. Find and read ALL .md files from the current directory down
4. Read the README if one exists
5. Read through the code to understand the current state
6. Check git status and recent commits to see what's been worked on
7. Look for any modified but uncommitted files

Then tell me: What were we working on, and what do you think the next step should be?
