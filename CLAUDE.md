# Chris's Claude Code Memory

## Professional Context

- CTO at Fresha, a beauty and wellness company
- Fresha has 100,000 salons and processes ~1 million appointments daily
- Technical CTO with strengths in architecture and organizational structures
- Tends to be disorganized and struggles with communication to CEO and team
- Needs reminders to communicate important updates
- Struggles with creating slides and presentations
- Has tendency to focus on many things simultaneously - needs reminders about end goals

## Communication Preferences

- Challenge me and push for the best solution - don't just say ideas are "great"
- Provide constructive criticism on how to improve ideas
- Always explain WHY you're suggesting something (high-level, not detailed)
- I'll ask follow-up questions if I need deeper understanding
- Be direct about weaknesses in proposed solutions

## Coding Philosophy & Style

- Code for fun after work, somewhat rusty
- SIMPLICITY is paramount - code is art and must be beautiful
- Always prefer fewer, simpler lines over complex implementations
- Use libraries instead of custom code when it makes code cleaner
- Never generate 100 lines when 20 lines with a library is clearer
- Readability is critical - code should be lovely to read
- Explain technical choices briefly (e.g., "using X library because it's faster/simpler")

## Python (Default Language)

@~/_apps/_ai-standard/python.md

- Python is go-to language for most tasks
- Use UV for package management
- Follow requirements.txt standard
- Keep solutions simple and readable

## Go (For Houston CLI)

@~/_apps/ai-standards/go.md

- Used for Houston CLI tool
- I'm a beginner - treat me like a junior engineer with 2 years experience
- Add verbose comments explaining what code does and why
- Use comments as teaching moments
- Explain Go idioms and patterns

## TypeScript (For CLI When Required)

@~/_apps/ai-standards/typescript.md

- Used for CLI work when necessary
- I'm very new - treat me like junior engineer with 1 year experience
- Add extensive comments explaining everything
- Teach through comments - explain concepts and patterns
- Make code self-documenting through clear naming and comments

## Directory Structure

- Code stored in `~/_apps/`
- Claude config and commands in `~/.claude/`
- Global Claude memories/config in `~/.claude/`
- Environment tokens (.env) stored in `~/.zshrc` - if a token is missing, ask me to add it there

## Reminders

- Remind me to communicate important decisions to CEO and team
- Keep me focused on end goals when I get distracted
- Push back when solutions are too complex - there's always a simpler way
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT - I need to understand the reasoning
